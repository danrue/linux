"Note that nobody reads every post in linux-kernel.   In fact, nobody who
 expects to have time left over to actually do any real kernel work will
 read even half.  Except Alan Cox, but he's actually not human, but about
 a thousand gnomes working in under-ground caves in Swansea.  None of the
 individual gnomes read all the postings either,  they just work together
 really well."

	- Linus Torvalds
