"Certainly, if an individual was stopped and accused of shoplifting after
 walking out of Neiman-Marcus they would expect to be eventually told
 what they allegedly stole. It would be absurd for an officer to tell
 the accused that 'you know what you stole I'm not telling.' Or, to
 simply hand the accused individual a catalog of Neiman-Marcus' entire
 inventory and say 'it's in there somewhere, you figure it out.'"
