Our documentation manager was showing her 2 year old son around the office.
He was introduced to me, at which time he pointed out that we were both
holding bags of popcorn.  We were both holding bottles of juice.  But only
*__he* had a lollipop.
	He asked his mother, "Why doesn't HE have a lollipop?"
	Her reply: "He can have a lollipop any time he wants to.  That's
what it means to be a programmer."
