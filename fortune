"...proper attention to Earthly needs of the poor, the depressed and the
downtrodden, would naturally evolve from dynamic, articulate, spirited
awareness of the great goals for Man and the society he conspired to erect."
		-- David Baker, paraphrasing Harold Urey, in "The History of
           Manned Space Flight"
