"I'm a bastard. I have absolutely no clue why people can ever think
 otherwise. Yet they do. People think I'm a nice guy, and the fact is that
 I'm a scheming, conniving bastard who doesn't care for any hurt feelings
 or lost hours of work if it just results in what I consider to be a better
 system."

 	- Linus Torvalds
