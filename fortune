"The last time anybody made a list of the top hundred 
character attributes of New Yorkers, common sense snuck in 
at number 79. ....
When it's fall in New York, the air smells as if someone's 
been frying goats in it, and if you are keen to breathe the 
best plan is to open a window and stick your head in a 
building." 

- Nuff said??
