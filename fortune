Here's the thing about lawyers: they don't write to communicate. Lawyers
are like programmers, their code doesn't have to be human-readable. It may
even be deliberately obfuscated. It just has to run on the target system and
produce the desired outcome. In the case of terms-of-use language, the target
system is the courts, and the desired outcome is income.
