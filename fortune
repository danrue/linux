Yuppie Wannabes:
	An X generation subgroup that believes the myth of a yuppie
life-style being both satisfying and viable.  Tend to be highly in
debt, involved in some form of substance abuse, and show a willingness
to talk about Armageddon after three drinks.
		-- Douglas Coupland, "Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated
		   Culture"
