"`I think you ought to know that I'm feeling very 
depressed.'"
"`Life, don't talk to me about life.'"
"`Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to 
take you down to the bridge. Call that "job satisfaction"? 
'Cos I don't.'"
"`I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my 
left side.'"

- Guess who.
