			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 6

proof by picture:
	A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well
	with proof by omission.

proof by vehement assertion:
	It is useful to have some kind of authority relation to the
	audience.

proof by ghost reference:
	Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears in
	the reference given.
